    * An overview of the project and its purpose
The Interactive Visa Requirement Map is a tool designed to simplify the process of understanding global travel restrictions and visa requirements. Its primary purpose is to provide travelers with an easy-to-use, visual representation of the visa requirements for different countries, indicating whether a visa is required, visa-free, not admitted, visa on arrival, or if an e-visa is required.

	In developing this project, we prioritized ethical considerations in handling data and presenting information.  
	 We are committed to:
* Accuracy: Ensuring that the visa information is accurate and up-to-date, sourced from reliable and official sources.
* Privacy: Respecting user privacy by not tracking or storing personal information or search history.
* Accessibility: Making the map accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following web accessibility standards.
* Cultural Sensitivity: Presenting information in a manner that is respectful and sensitive to different cultures and practices.
