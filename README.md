    * An overview of the project and its purpose
The Interactive Visa Requirement Map is a tool designed to simplify the process of understanding global travel restrictions and visa requirements. Its primary purpose is to provide travelers with an easy-to-use, visual representation of the visa requirements for different countries, indicating whether a visa is required, visa-free, not admitted, visa on arrival, or if an e-visa is required.




    * Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
To use the Interactive Visa Requirement Map:
    1. Navigate to the map on our website.
    2. Use the drop down menu on the top left to view its specific visa requirements.
    3. Use the legend to understand the color coding for different visa statuses.
    4. For detailed information, hover over the country to view the specific visa requirements and procedures, like how many visa free days are allowed. 



    * At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
	In developing this project, we prioritized ethical considerations in handling data and presenting 				information. We are committed to:
Accuracy: Ensuring that the visa information is accurate and up-to-date, sourced from reliable and official sources.
Privacy: Respecting user privacy by not tracking or storing personal information or search history.
Accessibility: Making the map accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following web accessibility standards.
Cultural Sensitivity: Presenting information in a manner that is respectful and sensitive to different cultures and practices.
